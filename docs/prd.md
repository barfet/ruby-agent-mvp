# Project Requirement Document: Customer Support & Research Assistant MVP

## 1. Project Overview

### Purpose and Goals
- Create a functional MVP that showcases integration between Ruby on Rails and OpenAI's agent capabilities
- Demonstrate multi-agent orchestration in a Ruby environment
- Provide practical implementation of built-in tools (file search, web search, computer use)
- Establish a foundation for understanding AI-enhanced customer support workflows
- Serve as a learning platform for Ruby developers interested in AI agent integration

### Target Users
- Primary: Ruby developers wanting to understand AI agent integration
- Secondary: Customer support teams looking for AI-assisted workflow improvements
- Tertiary: End customers seeking immediate support without human intervention

### Key Features and Benefits
- Chat-based interface for natural language interaction
- Automated triage of customer inquiries
- Intelligent knowledge base lookups
- Real-time web research for current information
- Automated support ticket creation
- Transparent agent orchestration with logging and traceability

## 2. Functional Requirements

### User Interface Requirements
- Simple, responsive chat UI with user and agent message bubbles
- Input field for user queries
- Visual indicators for agent processing
- Support for displaying formatted text, links, and citations
- Chat history persisted within a session

### Agent System Requirements
- **Triage Agent**: Analyzes queries and routes to appropriate specialized agent
- **Knowledge Agent**: Integrates with file search tool to access internal documents
- **Research Agent**: Uses web search tool to find external, up-to-date information
- **Support-Ticket Agent**: Leverages computer use tool to create tickets automatically

### Data Requirements
- Knowledge base storage for FAQs and product documentation
- Conversation logging with tracing of agent decision paths
- Support ticket reference tracking

## 3. Technical Architecture

### System Components
- Rails MVC architecture with Turbo/Hotwire for real-time updates
- Service objects for agent orchestration and API handling
- PostgreSQL database for relational data with JSON capabilities

### Database Schema
- `support_sessions`: Stores conversation contexts
- `messages`: Contains individual user and assistant messages
- `agent_traces`: Logs agent decisions and API calls
- `knowledge_documents`: Optional local storage for knowledge base
- `support_tickets`: Tracks created support tickets

### API Integrations
- OpenAI Responses API with tools integration
- Vector Store integration for knowledge retrieval
- Mock help desk system for ticket creation demonstration

## 4. Implementation Plan

### Development Phases
1. **Project Setup** (1-2 days): Rails app initialization, database setup, API configuration
2. **Chat Interface** (2-3 days): UI components, real-time updates, session management
3. **Triage Agent** (2-3 days): Query routing logic, prompt engineering
4. **Knowledge Agent** (2-3 days): Document storage, file search tool integration
5. **Research Agent** (2-3 days): Web search integration, response synthesis
6. **Support-Ticket Agent** (2-3 days): Help desk interface, computer use tool implementation
7. **Testing and Refinement** (2-3 days): Comprehensive testing, UX improvements
8. **Documentation and Deployment** (1-2 days): Code documentation, deployment setup

### Resource Requirements
- 1 Rails developer (full-time)
- OpenAI API account with access to Responses API and built-in tools
- Development and staging environments

## 5. Technical Implementation Details

### Gems and Dependencies
```ruby
# Gemfile
gem 'ruby-openai', '~> 5.0'  # For OpenAI API integration
gem 'pg', '~> 1.5'           # PostgreSQL adapter
gem 'turbo-rails'            # For real-time updates
gem 'stimulus-rails'         # For JS interactions
gem 'tailwindcss-rails'      # For UI styling (optional)
gem 'dotenv-rails'           # For environment variables
```

### Core Service Objects
- `AgentService`: Base service with common functionality
- `TriageAgentService`: Routes user queries to specialized agents
- `KnowledgeAgentService`: Retrieves information using file search
- `ResearchAgentService`: Finds external information using web search
- `SupportTicketAgentService`: Creates tickets using computer use
- `AgentOrchestratorService`: Manages the flow between agents

### Controller and View Implementation
- `SupportSessionsController`: Handles chat sessions and message processing
- Real-time message updates with Turbo Streams
- Confirmation flow for sensitive operations

## 6. Testing and Quality Assurance

### Testing Approach
- Unit testing for models and service objects
- Integration testing for agent orchestration flows
- System testing for end-to-end user workflows
- Prompt engineering testing for edge cases

### Success Criteria
- Triage agent correctly categorizes >90% of test queries
- Knowledge/Research agents retrieve relevant information with >80% accuracy
- Support ticket agent creates tickets with >95% accuracy
- Average response times <5 seconds for knowledge and research queries

## 7. Deployment Considerations

### Environment Setup
- Ruby version: 3.2.0+
- Rails version: 7.0.0+
- Database: PostgreSQL 14+
- Required environment variables:
  - OPENAI_API_KEY
  - OPENAI_VECTOR_STORE_IDS
  - HELP_DESK_URL

### Security Considerations
- Secure API key storage
- Rate limiting to prevent abuse
- User input sanitization
- Proper error handling

## 8. Future Enhancements

### Immediate Post-MVP Improvements
- User authentication and role-based permissions
- Conversation history search and filtering
- Additional knowledge sources integration

### Long-term Potential Features
- Multi-language support
- Voice interface integration
- Analytics dashboard for support trends
- Integration with actual CRM/support systems

## 9. Risks and Mitigations

### Technical Risks
- API rate limits: Implement caching and efficient prompt design
- Service availability: Add fallback mechanisms and error handling
- Performance issues: Profile and optimize application regularly

### Business Risks
- Inaccurate responses: Implement human review mechanisms
- User privacy concerns: Clear communication of data usage policies
- Cost escalation: Usage monitoring and budgeting tools
