Below is a single MVP project idea that ties together all the new OpenAI functionalities (Responses API, built-in tools, multi-agent orchestration) in a Ruby on Rails application. The concept is a “Customer Support & Research Assistant” that can:
	1.	Triage user requests (decide which agent handles them).
	2.	Provide quick answers from an internal knowledge base (using the file search tool).
	3.	Look up current, external information on the web (using the web search tool).
	4.	Perform basic “computer use” tasks, such as automatically creating a ticket in a web-based support system (using the computer use tool).

You’ll get to experiment with multi-agent orchestration, built-in tools, prompt engineering, and basic safety/guardrail logic—all in one small Rails project.

1. High-Level Concept

Imagine a “unified support agent” that a user interacts with via chat in your Rails app. The user might type things like:
	•	“I’m having an issue with my product’s battery life.”
	•	“Can you check if there’s any warranty info about this problem?”
	•	“Is there a quick fix suggested by the community?”
	•	“Also, can you open a support ticket for me automatically?”

When the user hits Send, your application:
	1.	Routes the user’s query to a triage agent that decides if the request is about knowledge base lookup, external web research, or if we need to create a new support ticket.
	2.	Calls the appropriate specialized agent (like an FAQ lookup agent, or a web research agent, or an agent that can open a ticket using the “computer use” tool).
	3.	Executes the necessary steps (e.g., using the new file search built-in tool to retrieve relevant internal docs, or using web search to find the latest info, or using computer use to fill out a form in your help-desk system).
	4.	Returns a final, consolidated response to the user, possibly with citations, relevant doc snippets, or a confirmation that a support ticket is created.

2. Key Features (and How They Demonstrate OpenAI’s New Tools)
	1.	Multiple Agents / Orchestration
	•	Triage Agent: Uses short instructions to route the user’s request to the correct specialized agent.
	•	Knowledge Agent: Uses file search to retrieve relevant knowledge-base or FAQ documents from your stored files in OpenAI’s vector store.
	•	Research Agent: Uses web search to look for external resources or up-to-date info.
	•	Support-Ticket Agent: Uses computer use to open a ticket in a web-based help-desk form (or a dummy service for demonstration).
	2.	Responses API
	•	Each specialized agent call can be made via the new Responses API endpoint rather than chat.completions. This allows multi-turn usage of built-in tools in a single API call.
	3.	Built-In Tools
	•	File Search (internal knowledge base / vector store).
	•	Web Search (for external data, real-time updates, or up-to-date product news).
	•	Computer Use (automatic form-filling, data entry, ticket creation).
	4.	Observability / Tracing
	•	You log each agent’s final request and response in your Rails database. This helps you see the chain of decisions made by triage agent and specialized agents.
	5.	Simple Guardrails
	•	For instance, if the user triggers a “computer use” request, your triage agent might require them to confirm: “You want me to open a ticket using your account—yes/no?” before proceeding.

3. Proposed Rails Architecture

A. Models
	•	SupportSession: Stores the user’s conversation context, any logs/traces of agent calls, and the final results.
	•	Document (optional): If you want to store knowledge-base docs in your Rails DB, then push them to OpenAI’s vector store via the new file_search tool or the Vector Store API.

B. Controllers
	•	SupportSessionsController: One main controller with an action like #create to handle new user messages.
	•	This calls your TriageAgentOrchestrator (or whatever you name it) service to decide how to handle the request.

C. Service Objects (Agents + Orchestrator)
	1.	TriageAgent (decides: knowledge vs. research vs. support-ticket).
	2.	KnowledgeAgent (calls responses.create with the file_search tool).
	3.	ResearchAgent (calls responses.create with the web_search_preview tool).
	4.	SupportTicketAgent (calls responses.create with the computer_use_preview tool to fill out a form).

D. Views
	•	A simple chat UI showing user messages on one side, agent responses on the other.

4. Data Flow Example
	1.	User: “I’m having trouble with my device battery. Is there a known fix?”
	2.	App sends the message to the Triage Agent (Responses API call with instructions: “Output which agent to hand off to: KnowledgeAgent or ResearchAgent or SupportTicketAgent.”).
	3.	Triage decides: “This is probably an internal knowledge question—use KnowledgeAgent.”
	4.	App then calls the KnowledgeAgent with the user’s query, specifying tools: [{ type: "file_search", vector_store_ids: [...] }].
	5.	The KnowledgeAgent’s LLM usage runs any relevant doc retrieval, uses them to craft an answer, and returns the final text.
	6.	App displays: “According to our knowledge base, Model X has a known battery fix. You can try updating the firmware. Here’s a link to the firmware update instructions.”

If the user then says, “I can’t find that link—can you see if there’s a more up-to-date suggestion online?”:
	1.	Triage decides: “That’s a research question.”
	2.	Calls the ResearchAgent with tools: [{ type: "web_search_preview" }].
	3.	Returns a final message with an external link: “According to a recent article (cited link), the latest firmware is at Example.com.”

Finally, if they say, “Can you open a support ticket for me automatically?”:
	1.	Triage: “Use the SupportTicketAgent.”
	2.	The SupportTicketAgent uses tools: [{ type: "computer_use_preview", environment: "browser" }] to simulate filling out a web-based form in your help desk system.
	3.	The model returns something like “Ticket #1234 created successfully.”
	4.	You log that agent’s output in your database, show it to the user, and you might ask them to confirm it was correct.

5. Why This MVP Is Great
	1.	Covers Every Built-In Tool
	•	You get to see file search in action for knowledge retrieval, web search for up-to-date info, and computer use to automate tasks.
	2.	Practices Multi-Agent Orchestration
	•	Triage vs. specialized agents is a natural pattern to help you test how to pass a user’s prompt around different contexts.
	3.	Provides Real Value
	•	Even as an MVP, you could expand this into a genuine internal or public support assistant for your product or company.
	4.	Tests Observability & Safety
	•	You’ll practice logging each step, storing user queries/responses, adding optional confirmation steps, etc.

6. Next Steps & Extensions
	1.	Add More Agents: Maybe a “Sales Agent” that automatically updates a CRM record (again using “computer use” or a custom function).
	2.	Authentication & Role-Based Security: Let different user roles (customer vs. support staff) have different agent abilities.
	3.	Expand the Knowledge Base: Test how large or complex you can get with file search retrieval.
	4.	Leverage the Agents SDK (Python) if needed: If you’re okay mixing languages, you could orchestrate some parts in Python (with the official Agents SDK) and connect them to your Rails app via an internal API. Otherwise, replicate the logic in Ruby as described.

Final Summary

Build a “Customer Support & Research Assistant” Rails app that features:
	1.	A triage agent
	2.	A knowledge agent (file search)
	3.	A research agent (web search)
	4.	A support-ticket agent (computer use)

All orchestrated via the Responses API in your Rails backend. The user simply interacts with a single chat interface; under the hood, your orchestrator routes the request to the correct agent and uses the new built-in tools. This MVP will exercise every major new piece of functionality from OpenAI’s announcement, all while giving you a tangible product to experiment with in Ruby on Rails.
